## 20. Inline Text Elements
Make sure that these tags should only be used for semantic purpose.
Don't use these tags just for styling. Although if you want to style
your text with the similar styles, you can use the bootstrap classes.

For example, you can use the mock class for getting these styles, same
as the mock tag, small class for getting these styles, same as small
tag, text decoration underlying class for getting the style same as the
underlying tag.

```
<p>This is a <mark>Mark Tag</mark></p>
<p>This is a <span class="mark">Mark Tag</p>
```
As you can see, the style looks exactly like the **mark tag**, but this
one is just applying a class and this one is using a semantic element.
