## 41. Badges

Badges are inline styled elements which you can use anywhere,
like heading tags and paragraphs. Badges look like a small button
but are not actually buttons, Badges can be scaled to match your DOM
element. For example, if you use a badge and h1 tag, it would inherit
the size of an h1 and if you use it in a paragraph tag, it would inherit
the size of a paragraph. Also in Bootstrap 5, badges have no longer
have focus or hover styles for links.

## 42. Breadcrumb
Breadcrumbs are a way to show the current page location to the user.
Bootstrap helps in adding an automatic separator for each page with
the help of CSS

### Entity
An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). You can also use them in place of other characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard.
