In bootstrap we have a lot of styles every component of a form of a form
element can be styled with bootstrap.

Form Control includes styles for input fields and text areas for multiple
states

For checkboxes and radios there are custom check fields or radial fields
in bootstrap, which we can use for building input options

To get increased the semantic value we can use the input group and bootstrap
with combination to the labels and fields

With the help of layouts, we can create inline forms, horizontal forms
and much complex grid based layouts

The select styles in bootstrap improves the default select field, what we have in HTML

Bootstrap also comes with a range fill which replaces the default browser range

With the help of floating labels, you can create beautiful grid and simple form labels
which can float over your form fields

You can use the default or custom form validation and add behaviors to your form fields
